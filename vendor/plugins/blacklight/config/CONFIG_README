The Blacklight plugin's config directory is currently used for running the plugin as a stand-alone app for testing purposes.

You will need:

database.yml   (copy database.example;  if you want to use MySQL, instead of
    sqlite3, see
    http://wiki.blacklightopac.org/doku.php?id=installing_the_demo_app )
    
solr.yml   (copy solr.example)


in initializers sub-directory:

blacklight_config.rb
